# DocSynapse - Backend Implementation Stories

## Backend Architecture Vision

### The FastAPI Application Story
The DocSynapse backend serves as the intelligent orchestrator of the entire documentation transformation process. It receives requests from the frontend, manages complex crawling operations, processes content through multiple stages, and provides real-time progress updates. The backend is built with FastAPI to leverage Python's excellent web scraping ecosystem while providing modern API features.

### Core Responsibilities Story
The backend handles five critical responsibilities:

**Request Orchestration**: Receives crawling requests, validates them, and creates unique job identifiers for tracking.

**Crawler Management**: Coordinates Playwright browsers to discover and extract content from documentation sites.

**Content Processing**: Cleans, deduplicates, and optimizes extracted content for LLM consumption.

**Progress Communication**: Provides real-time updates to the frontend through WebSocket connections.

**File Generation**: Creates and serves the final markdown files optimized for AI consumption.

## Application Structure Story

### FastAPI Application Initialization Story
The AI agent should create a FastAPI application that initializes with proper lifecycle management. The application uses an async context manager to handle startup and shutdown operations, ensuring resources like browser instances are properly managed.

The application should be configured with:
- **CORS middleware** to allow frontend connections from development and production origins
- **Static file serving** for generated documentation files
- **Automatic API documentation** at `/docs` endpoint
- **Health check endpoints** for monitoring
- **Proper error handling** with user-friendly error messages

### Configuration Management Story
The AI agent should implement a comprehensive configuration system using Pydantic Settings that:

**Environment-Based Configuration**: Loads settings from environment variables with sensible defaults for development.

**Crawler Configuration**: Includes settings for maximum concurrent requests, delays, timeouts, and user agent strings.

**File Management**: Configures output directories, file size limits, and retention policies.

**Security Settings**: Manages CORS origins, rate limiting, and other security parameters.

**Optional Features**: Provides configuration for Redis integration and advanced features.

### Logging System Story
The AI agent should implement a sophisticated logging system that:

**Structured Logging**: Uses consistent log formats with timestamps, log levels, and contextual information.

**File and Console Output**: Logs to both files (with rotation) and console for development and production.

**Component-Specific Logging**: Different log levels for different components (crawler, processor, API).

**Error Tracking**: Detailed error logging with stack traces for debugging production issues.

## Data Models Story

### Request and Response Models Story
The AI agent should create Pydantic models that define the API contract:

**CrawlRequest Model**: Defines the structure for incoming crawl requests including:
- Base URL with validation for proper HTTP/HTTPS format
- Optional parameters for max pages, include/exclude patterns
- Rate limiting preferences and timeout settings
- Robots.txt compliance preferences

**Progress Tracking Models**: Defines structures for tracking crawl progress including:
- Job status enumeration (pending, crawling, processing, completed, failed)
- Real-time progress metrics (pages discovered, crawled, processed)
- Time estimates and performance statistics
- Current operation details and error information

**Result Models**: Defines structures for crawl results including:
- Success/failure status with detailed error information
- Generated file information with download URLs
- Site structure analysis and metadata
- Performance metrics and completion statistics

### WebSocket Message Models Story
The AI agent should create models for real-time communication:

**Message Types**: Define different types of WebSocket messages for progress updates, errors, and completion notifications.

**Progress Updates**: Structured messages containing current crawling status, percentage complete, and estimated time remaining.

**Error Messages**: Detailed error information that helps users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

**Completion Messages**: Final status with download links, file information, and summary statistics.

## Core Services Architecture Story
